Updating from 0.3.x to 0.4.x
=============================

Katon doesn't use Pow anymore to proxy requests.

This means that you can uninstall Pow if you want:
$ curl get.pow.cx/uninstall.sh | sh

Also, since .dev will become a real domain name soon, katon will now serve your app on .ka domain.

Katon needs now to install files. If you want to run it later, just use:
$ katon install
