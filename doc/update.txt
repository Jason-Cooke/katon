Updating from 0.3.x to 0.4.x
=============================

First, thank you for using katon!

katon 0.4 is a special release:

1. It doesn't use Pow anymore to proxy requests. This means that you can uninstall Pow if you want:
   $ curl get.pow.cx/uninstall.sh | sh

2. It will now serve your app on .ka domain since .dev will become a real domain soon.

3. katon now needs root access to install some files.

For any problem:

=============================

katon will now install itself. If you want to run the installation later use:
$ katon install
