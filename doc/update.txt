Updating from 0.3.x to 0.4.x
=============================

First, thanks for using Katon.

Katon 0.4 is a special release:

1. It doesn't use Pow anymore to proxy requests. This means that you can uninstall Pow if you want:
$ curl get.pow.cx/uninstall.sh | sh

2. It will now serve your app on .ka domain since .dev will become a real domain soon.

3. Katon now needs root access to install some files.

For any problem:

Now katon will install itself, if you want to run the installation later use:
$ katon install
